# Herodotusism

**Herodotusism** is a project aimed at the digitization of global history, transforming historical events into structured, actionable data units. Inspired by Herodotus, the "Father of History," this project draws from his method of chronicling events while utilizing modern data science to store, analyze, and interpret the vast expanse of human history.

### Features
- Transforming historical facts into **data entries** that can be searched, queried, and analyzed.
- Structuring data with time, location, people, events, and sources for comprehensive historical research.
- Allowing the exploration of historical relationships, causes, and impacts in a **data-driven** approach.

### Why Herodotusism?
Herodotus was the first to systematically document the events and stories of human civilization. He began the journey of preserving history for future generations. **Herodotusism** continues this mission by modernizing the collection of historical data and making it accessible and analyzable in today's digital age.

### Key Features:
- **Event-Driven Data**: Each historical fact is stored as a unique, verifiable data unit, tied to time, place, and relevant individuals.
- **Data Search & Analysis**: A flexible system to query historical data and generate insights based on various criteria.
- **Cross-Event Relationships**: Establish connections between related historical events, providing a network of historical context and causality.
